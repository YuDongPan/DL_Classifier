# Aim & Scope
This repository is provided for replicating the deep learning-based recognition methods of SSVEP signals. The replicated methods include EEGNet [1]-[2], C-CNN [3], FBtCNN [4], ConvCA [5], SSVEPNet [6], and SSVEPformer [7]. 
The file distribution follow the code desgin of <a href="https://github.com/YuDongPan/SSVEPNet">SSVEPNet</a>. And a 12-class public dataset [6] was used to conduct evaluation.

# Introduction
- EEGNet: EEGNet is a convolutional neural network model specifically designed for processing EEG signal data, which receives time-domain EEG data as network input. EEGNet consists of 4 layers. The first layer is a convolutional layer that simulates bandpass filtering for each channel. The second layer is a spatial filtering layer that weights the data from each channel, achieved through depth-wise convolution. The third layer is a separate convolutional layer for extracting category information. The fourth layer is a fully connected layer for classification. Since its proposal, EEGNet has been used in various EEG tasks, such as motor imagery, P300, SSVEP, etc [1]-[2].
